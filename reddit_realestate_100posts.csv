Protect yourselves from Credit Agencies selling your information. www.optoutprescreen.com,"One of the most common questions posted here is:

Why did I get a hundred phone calls from lenders after I got pre-approved?

Answer:

Because the credit agencies sold your information.

How do credit agencies like Experian, Equifax and Transunion make money?

Well one route is through something referred to as ""trigger leads"". When a lender pulls your credit, they are sending a request to the credit agencies for your credit report and score.

When the credit agency receives this request, they know you are in the market for a loan. So they sell that ""lead"" to hundreds of other lenders looking to vulture your business. The credit agencies know everything about you. Your name, your SSN, your current debts, your phone number, your email, your current and past addresses etc. And they sell all this information.

Well wait you might say. ""Don't I want to get a quote from hundreds of lenders to find the lowest possible rate?""

Sure. If that's why they were calling you. But a large portion of these callers are not going to offer you lower rates, they're simply trying to trick you into moving your loan, especially because buying all those leads costs money. Quite a few will lie and say they work for your current lender. Some overtly, some by omitting that they are a different lender. ""Hi! I'm just reaching out to collect the loan documents for your application!""

On the positive, they'll usually stop calling within a few days, but that's still a few days and a few hundred calls more than anyone wants to receive.

Currently the only way to stop your information from being sold is to go to the official website www.optoutprescreen.com and removing yourself.",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1hao3ij/protect_yourselves_from_credit_agencies_selling/
How do people afford full home remodels (full gut)?,"Hey all, homeowner in California. Our home was built in the 50s, and has been updated over time (dual-pane windows done maybe 20 years ago, an add-on done a long time ago, bathrooms done 20 years ago, floors done 5 years ago, etc.). At some point in the near future we need to redo the bathrooms and the kitchen, and probably also repaint/repair all the walls in the house. I would plan to pay for these with cash most likely, so would wait to do those until we've saved that amount.

A lot of homes for sale in our area for sale look like they have had full remodels where the entire home was completely updated all at once. I haven't done the math on where this begins to be more economical vs. lots of piecemeal projects or updating only specific parts of the house. Regardless, the main thing I don't really get is how people are paying for these large remodels. We live in an expensive area and I would imagine these jobs cost $500k+.

Our house has almost doubled in value since we bought it (very lucky on timing), so we have tons of equity to pull out. I'm just new to this and unclear what most people do to fund these large remodels.

Do most folks use HELOCs for these? Or am I just relatively poor compared to these folks and they can afford to pay $500k-$1m in cash on top of their $3-4m home?",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jjrb7f/how_do_people_afford_full_home_remodels_full_gut/

Need advice for townhome on market MA,"Listed our townhome on Thursday. We are in one of the top school district in MA. Getting into the city is not easy due to traffic but still a desirable neighborhood due to schools. Home right behind the school with walking distance.

We had about30 parties visit the home during open house. One even offered a significant higher amount the next day in email but then did not proceed forward saying the level 1 floor plan isn’t ideal for them. Another family needs a backyard so they didn’t move forward beyond their verbal offer.

Third family is considering putting an offer (deadline today- Tuesday) 5 days since listing. Their agent was very clear that they will wait until last minute and offer lower than asking since no other offers on the table.

How bad is it if the home is not sold the first weekend in a great town in MA? What are we doing wrong? We will assess the price after this second weekends open house. Inventory is low in our town. One disadvantage I see is it’s a big townhome so someone might prefer an older single family with yard in that price. But there aren’t any single family in this range with similar sqft. They are 200-300K more than our price. Also our HOA is very reasonable. Less than $300. High RE taxes though.

Easement question - Tennessee,"I am trying to figure out who to ask for an easement on a prospective property.

Property 1 owns the road frontage easement and property 2 has rights to use easement to get to property. Property 2 owns entire driveway on their property.

Property 3 and 4 do not have any current rights - they've never needed them.

I want to purchase the top half of property 4 (to make property 5) and want to ask for easement rights. Can property 2 allow use of their easement rights if I asked to purchase rights,or would I have to go directly to the easement owner at property 1?

Building in a flood zone,"I have a plot of undeveloped land that is in a Zone A flood zone. The BFE would be 6' above the current ground level based on FEMAs webiste, so building there would be impractical. Yet, there homes built on the same flood zone in the same road which are not that high. Could i argue to either FEMA or local county that I should be able to build as well considering my neighbors have built?

The county requires 3' elevation above BFE for them to issue a permit. That would mean raising the ground 9' high to meet requirements to build. Which would be both expensive and silly to do.

Advice needed: my agent is taking my money,"I just bought a town home. I found the property myself. It’s a new construction so it was a fixed-price unit, no negotiation, or anything along the way. As such, I didn’t need any assistance from a real estate agent other than signing off at closing. I should add I have owned multiple properties and am not a newbie at this. So I called a realtor that I know and offered a fixed $$ amount to just show up and be my agent at closing. No work required. Realtor says yes that’s great and we sign a contract for the specified amount.

Fast forward two years to two weeks ago. The day before closing, there’s a curveball. The rules of our financing/loan would only permit a 2.0% credit back to me at closing (and the buyer’s agent commission was 3.0%). So the commission amount that had to be allocated to my realtor was larger than previously contemplated (which was a fixed $$ amount).

The day before closing I call my realtor to tell her this and that she will just need to cut me a check after closing for the extra commission she received (above and beyond what we had originally agreed), less her brokerage’s split and taxes she would need to pay on that excess income. She says yes.

After the transaction closes, I don’t hear from her for two weeks. I then send her a text asking where the check is. She then proceeds to tell me she will not send me any money and she’s just keeping it all. She’s says she could risk her license. So conveniently she has to keep all this money, above what we had agreed would be her fee.

Question to Real Estate Reddit: is she right? What are the penalties if she honors our agreement and writes me a personal check? Do agents ever lose their license for this? Or otherwise penalized? Btw, this agent previously wrote a check in a similar situation and didn’t lose her license.

Btw I live in Colorado.",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jiw2h6/advice_needed_my_agent_is_taking_my_money/

Buy Now or Build Next year,"My wife and I have been planning on building a home with start date of October of 2025. The same house we are planning to build is currently on the market. It was built in 2021 and has most everything we want.

The house that's on the market is also missing some things that we wanted to add (fireplace, extra cabinets & sink in the laundry room, soaking tub in the master, etc). The price of the new build is likely $635,000 to $665,000 (depends on what happens with the tariffs), the house that's been listed is $565,000, but we would do some upgrades as we move in (repaint, add fireplace, add backyard fence due to lot size).

Submitting an offer under list....,"Hi All,

I have an agent and we have looked twice at a home that has been listed for 17 days with no offers (quite a long time in our market).

The house seems to be overpriced. Some facts:

We live in a modest cost of real estate area but with high taxes. The median home value according to Zillow (I know), is 240k. Values appear to be going up about 9% year over year here since 2023. Houses certainly seem to be selling for higher though.

Home is listed for 460k.

Was listed last summer for 490k and did not sell.

Purchased cash out of foreclosure for 230k in summer of 2023- looks like the long time owner had passed away in 2018 (had owned the home since 1980s). No one has lived in the home since 2023 at least.

The gunite inground pool was covered with a tarp and cinderblocks, the pool heater and pump were not even switched to the winterize position. There appears to be new windows throughout. Boiler hear. Roof will need done in 5-7 years, will be finishing partially finishe basement to add over 1000sq feet with multiple points of egress including straight walk out. The bathrooms were horribly redone in what is obviously the quick cheap ""i know a guy"" way.

Electric is 150 amps and I'd like to pull that up to 200.

I know I will be putting some money into this- I would LOVE to get this house in the high 300s. Is that crazy to write such an offer? I feel it is very clearly overpriced. No home on that street has ever sold this high, although I feel they could if listed now. The home is over 100 years old and brick and has a unique character and charm but needs a lot to get it where i want it. It feels pointless to put in an offer so below asking though.",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jjlygs/submitting_an_offer_under_list/

Home Purchase and Financing Advice?,"Hello,

I have a question regarding my current housing and financing situation.

Current home value: Approximately $700K
Remaining mortgage: $180K  → Our home equity is around $520K
Mortgage details: 15-year fixed at 2.4%; we've paid about 4 years, so ~11 years remain
Monthly payment (including escrow, principal, and interest): ~$2,400
Original loan amount: $250K

I also have a private investment account with stable and high returns. The balance is around $350K. However, this is a one-way account: if I withdraw funds, I cannot deposit money back in. So I would prefer not to touch it—but if necessary, I can use up to $100K from it.

My annual income is approximately $180K, and I have about $20K in liquid cash.

I recently applied for a mortgage through a lender recommended by my realtor. It was a soft pull and mostly to support my realtor’s suggestion (I suspect they may have a relationship). I don’t plan to use that lender in the end.

We're planning to purchase a new home in the $900K–$1M range within the next 1–3 months.

The lender told me that due to my existing mortgage and monthly payment, I only qualify for conditional approval with a 20% down payment, or unconditional approval if I put down significantly more. They also offered a bridge loan, but the fee seems quite high (2% of the new home's purchase price).

I know that “sell first, buy later” is often more cost-effective, but we have a 12-month-old baby, so that option would be difficult for us logistically.

Do you have any recommendations? I’ve heard of HELOC or other financing options, but I’m not sure how to utilize them in this situation.",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jjl3wa/home_purchase_and_financing_advice/

He gave us a quote of $25k-$30k. He did say with it just being two people in the house and the system not being completely shot, it could probably last some time but we aren’t looking to push it. Our realtor “warned” us there is no way we’re getting the full $30k from these sellers, not sure how he knows that, but we’re going to ask for as much as humanly possible. I don’t think it’s fair for us to inquire the bulk of the cost of this, the specialist feels positive the system has been failing for quite some time.

——————————————————-

Hi there, in the process of purchasing my first home. It’s on a septic, something I haven’t had any firsthand experience with.

We just had the septic inspection done today and the inspector said he sees signs of a saturated leach field. He thought the tank itself was fine and it’s been regularly pumped and we did see the receipts.

He thinks the lines are saturated and recommend they be repaired, which he estimated to be between $3k-$5k.

Since we aren’t familiar, we did some googling and are seeing that most people recommend overloading the system with bacteria and enzymes as a “fix”.

Were trying to get a clearer picture on an ideal resolve so we can figure out how to move forward — our realtor has recommended asking for credits, but since we aren’t sure how it’s fixed or what a repair even is (inspector did state that a line replacement is far more than a repair and not necessary) we aren’t sure what to ask for, credit wise.

Does anyone knowledgeable in septic systems have any insight that might help guide us on how to proceed?

Thank you!",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jj0wqm/purchasing_a_home_on_septic_inspection_showed/

"Finally found 1 great house, listing removed before offer date","I'm devastated and I feel like I got catfished. We spent the weekend touring the house, checking out everything about the neighborhood, spent a day looking at disclosures etc. I even dreamt about the house, looked at the pictures maybe 20x a day, ready to throw my fortune at it, and then 1 day before the offer date the listing got removed.

I know plans change but that sucks so bad. We've let the sellers know we still are interested, gave them an offer in case they changed their minds. Now I don't think I can be interested in another house again. I'm always waiting for this one to come back up, if it will even, and if it does there's no guarantee we get the house.

I offered a price above market rate, 15 days close, covering buyer agent fees. I'm throwing everything at them. I've fallen into the trap of falling in love with houses I haven't even won. It reminds me of how dating sucks, because you go out and fall in love and get rejected repeatedly, until you find one that accepts you.

To downsize or not to downsize..HELP!,"Looking for thoughtful advice.. here is the backstory:

I am a full time working mom and the only breadwinner in our family until our toddler goes to school full time not for another few years and I don’t know if I’m going to make it. I make low six figures and provide insurance for our entire family. I am also the “Big Boss” and recently earned equity in the company I’ve been with for other a decade so work is demanding a stressful but I have 4 years left on my contract to take away full equity so I need to stick it out. Lately (the last 6 months) I’ve been feeling like I simply can’t keep up with it all anymore. I have a rental house and a very large and “demanding” primary home that needs a good deal of attention. It is a historically marked home that we have completely brought back from the dead. It is our “dream home” and the home I want to raise our child in BUT between work and wanting to be an incredible mom who volunteers at school and goes to all my kiddos activities (she is after all, my greatest accomplishment and favorite part of life) I am terrified it has all just become too much to manage. I’ve had the REAL panic to downsize but I don’t know if I should given the long term benefits of keeping a home that will be work significantly more than anything else we can afford to buy at the current interest rates.

I have a rental home at 3% that generates $1600 net profit monthly. We plan to keep this home forever given its incredibly location and the income it generates. We also want to give this property to our child when she is an adult to do whatever she wants with. Live in, sell, rent etc.

Our primary home has a rate of 3.2% - We pay roughly $1500 out of pocket monthly after the rental income is applied. Our primary home will be worth at least 1.5 million in the next 15 years and we purchased it for $600k. Our 4500 sqft house also generates about $500-$600 in heating/gas bills monthly. It is also expensive to fix and we have a few big projects like the kitchen to remodel.

If we were to sell and purchase a significantly smaller home for around $400k (extremely hard to find in our area that isn’t tiny or a dump) even at the current interest rate, we wouldn’t pay anything out of pocket for mortgage monthly. The thought of less stress sounds amazing and I think would significantly reduce my stress level and allow me to truly enjoy time with my child more and allow for much more flexibility and allow me to emotionally be more available BUT I’m terrified of the following: - Downsizing into a house that is essentially 1/3 of the space we have now - Not giving my child the home and future she deserves - Letting go of a home that will be worth a good deal of money in the future - Moving to a less desirable area that isn’t within walking distance to all of my child’s favorite activities and school - Making the wrong move with a crappy interest rate that sets us back - Long term, any house we buy could never be worth what our primary home will be worth in the future

If you’re still with me, thank you for reading. I am a very decisive person 99.9% of the time but I just feel completely burnt out and something has to give.

FIRPTA withholding kerfuffle as buyer,"Ten days into escrow for condo. We suspect that the seller might be a foreign person.

The IRS verbiage EXPLICITLY states that the buyer is responsible for withholding the 10% (in this case): ""In most cases, the buyer (transferee) is the withholding agent. The transferee must find out if the transferor is a foreign person. If the transferor is a foreign person and the transferee fails to withhold, the transferee may be held liable for the tax.""

Escrow says they don't know the seller's residency status either way at this point as seller has not completed their opening escrow documents. There is no deadline for seller to complete their opening escrow documents - only to be completed before close of escrow.

Escrow also keeps trying to reassure us that all will be taken care of, yet has not produced tangible evidence to reassure us of this (such as a seller's affidavit stating that they are NOT a ""foreign"" person). From multiple phone conversations, the escrow person just says ""we can't sign anything (a ""Qualified Substitute"") if we don't have the information either"".

Real estate agent has been of zero help and keeps telling me not to worry without any recourse.

But of course no one is as concerned as I, the buyer, as it is my responsibility legally to produce an enormous amount to the IRS. I'm nervous proceeding past this contingency period without any guarantees as buyer needs to bear the risk. I don't have close to $70k to hand over to the IRS 20 days after closing if things go south. Seems like I'm getting the runaround and agent and escrow and both pointing to the other parties to keep things moving.

So the questions I have: 1. Why does all verbiage concerning FIRPTA state that buyer is responsible for withholding if this escrow company keeps saying that they are going to be the ones responsible for withholding?

Who is responsible for actually withholding? Me? Escrow?

How can I trust escrow to do their jobs and withhold?

Would I be better off with a real estate attorney?

If the IRS does send me a huge bill after closing, would I be able to point over to escrow to pay the man and would that hold up in a court setting?",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jjcx3c/firpta_withholding_kerfuffle_as_buyer/

It's on the ground floor, so not as desireable, but I do love the location. We feel we could put the work in to fix everything, but it might be 100k.

Comps in the area go for the 200k lower price, and they are all remodeled and updated, as well as many are on an upper floor.

Considering an auction after a year on the market,"My husband and I own five acres in a tourist area with a successful tiny house Airbnb on it (204 nights booked and 27k in revenue in 2024). It has been on the market for a year now and we are really eager to sell at this point. It is a bit of an odd property in that there is no structure with a foundation (the tiny home is on a trailer), so it is difficult to appraise and conventional financing isn’t really an option for a buyer. Our first realtor overpriced it by quite a bit and we have slowly come down in price by over 100k since first listing.

We have had a handful of showings over the past year but no formal offers. We received a verbal offer months ago that we should’ve jumped on but we were advised not to by the first agent. We’ve received at least 10 owner financing inquiries, but we’re really not interested in going that route.

Our current agent has recently suggested we think about offering it at auction and has connected us with a realtor who specializes in them. Unsurprisingly this new realtor is a huge proponent of auctions and thinks our property is perfect for it. We will pay $2500 upfront for her to market the hell out of it in an effort to reach cash buyers. This agent seems sharp, like she really knows the market and understands how to market our property. But, we’ve gotten a lot of bad advice along the way, which is why we’re still here with unsold property (that we should have sold months ago!). So I’m looking for unbiased opinions on how we should proceed. Does an auction seem like a reasonable next step? Or is it a bad idea? We are sooo ready to be done, but don’t want to leave money on the table. Appreciate any insights you can offer!

Edit to add: The new agent is the auctioneer! I should’ve clarified from the beginning. The $2500 is auction fees.",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jj7ivu/considering_an_auction_after_a_year_on_the_market/
Buying a Foreclosure,"I own a twin home in Hennepin County MN and I recently discovered the owner of the other half of the property is currently in jail due to Medicare fraud and likely delinquent on their mortgage. Based on the the mortgage amount and lines of credit showing opened on the property it seems very possible that it will go through foreclosure since I believe what is owed is more than it is worth. I would like to buy it if I can so I own the whole building vs just half and I would be able to pay cash.

My questions:

- Are there agents specializing in foreclosures I should be looking for to help me navigate through this process?

- Other than newspapers where should I be looking to determine if foreclosure action is starting on this property and identifying the auction date?

- The Hennepin County guidelines indicate that auctions must be paid for with cashiers check or cash at the time of sale, how do you get a cashiers check for an undetermined amount from your bank since you won't know what the winning bid will be until day of?

- Does the sheriff sale even matter or will the bank just purchase the property for what is owed and then auction off themselves at a later date for whatever they can recoup?

Taylor Morrison New Construction Red Flags,"Yesterday I viewed a new construction home with Taylor Morrison. They wanted $14,832 up front in earnest money, with no signed official purchase agreement.

They said their policy is that they send the official purchase agreement AFTER the payment is made to their website.

This is bad business practice. I hope no one falls for this. I chose not to proceed because every property I bought, the max earnest money I’ve put down was $3,000. Also because I’m not an idiot.

I should clarify, the house is near completion. The closing date is set to April.

Do you guys know if this is something they do to everyone? Why are they doing bad business?

Edit: One of the higher up managers contacted me and responded via email. Agreed to do $100 up front earnest money and the remaining $1,400 after we both sign the contract.

"Bought a townhome with a pneumatic vacuum elevator, keep or remove?","Previous owner had mobility issues and used this to get up this two story townhome.

House we might close on has oil tank buried in yard,";update; Realtor said she’ll look into it more tomorrow and request it to be decommissioned as part of the inspection response which we have in a few days. I guess we’ll see what seller does and if they say no deal then we’ll cut our losses and look for another house. Another thing is my husband looked at the public EPA website to look for tanks in the area and there’s no mention of this tank. Who knows how long it’s been sitting there, I mean I don’t know anything about their website but it should be registered there if it’s been emptied and taken care of on EPA level, right?

So we might close on a house built in the 1960’s, the issue that just came up after reviewing a change in the disclosures that were sent to us we were notified that there is a buried oil tank in the yard, no further information.

Don’t know if it’s empty, don’t know if the soil is contaminated, don’t know anything. We only figured this out as we were second in line to the house and the first buyer wanted a heavy discount or something, something about the tank but we don’t know anything else. If they got it tested or what and found out something we don’t know, ugh…

Sucks we love this house and it’s perfect for our family, besides the nightmare of an oil tank sitting in the yard we know nothing about and can be a big ass liability from what I’ve been reading.

We’re going to ask the sellers to pay to have to soil tested is our first step.

Asking realtor to apply part of commission to credit towards house?,"A family member suggested I do this when buying a house and said he's done it many times. The buyers agent should get (for example) 3% commission right? His thought was requesting the buyers agent to reduce their commission by 0.5% and apply it towards my closing costs or credit it towards the house. So they would instead get 2.5% instead of 3%. 0.5% of a $500,000 house is $2,500 which is still a nice chunk of change towards closing costs.

Is this a common practice? Part of me wonders why an agent would agree to this, or would some agents agree to this to attract more customers?",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jj02wj/asking_realtor_to_apply_part_of_commission_to/

Federal Tax Lien on property after foreclosure sale,"Hi there, there is a FTL (it is a junior lien, filed AFTER the mortgage) on a property purchased at a Sheriff's sale in PA.

It is my understanding the IRS has a 120 window to redeem the property or get the funds from the sale to satisfy their lien. If they choose not to, the lien is released in 120 days.

Now, the question comes of notice and time frame. If the United States was notified the sale was happening to the property, is that sufficient for proper notice to start the 120 days from when it was sold. Or do they need notified when it actually is SOLD. And if so, who does the notifying and how would a third party (like myself) go about that?",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jiu2st/federal_tax_lien_on_property_after_foreclosure/

2 competing escalation clauses,"I’m asking Reddit because I think my realtor is wrong. I’m selling my house. GA is the state. I have 2 offers. Listing price is 569k

Offer 1: 585k, but if seller receives other net offers at 585 or higher, then it escalates up to 605 with 5k increments. Otherwise it’s a normal offer, strong pre approval but going through traditional financing.

Offer 2: 575k but agrees to pay 2,500 more than the highest competing “net to seller” offer up To 606k. Terms are excellent, all cash.

We would have to produce the competing offer to either buyer, but these are legitimate offers they just came in weirdly similar.

Obviously, the second offer is better. For personal reasons, we wanted to sell it to the first person but money is money. If we were to accept the second offer, what is the sales price we would be accepting at? My realtor says 587,500. (We talked about it briefly but will be talking more in the morning). But that makes no sense to me. Why do the escalation clauses not escalate each other to max out offer 2? My realtor is very experienced and I like him, he’s done a great job setting up and marketing the property. But I do think he’s wrong here and I don’t know exactly how to ask him to confirm this without threatening to go over his head.

Thoughts on boosting real estate availability with a 1% federal tax on second homes?,"Could a 1% tax imposed by the federal government on second homes, including those owned by corporations, lead to a substantial increase in available real estate on the market?

Need education on a Sherriff's sale,"I am in the process of relocating from TX to PA and have found the area in PA I am moving to does not have much inventory of homes available at all. It is a rural area. In the search I have found a property I am highly interested in, but it is going to a Sherriff's sale.

I have read a lot of posts here and understand this is risky. My motivation really isn't to save money, it is to actually find a piece of property that meets my criteria. The location is fantastic as is the size...its a multi acre parcel. There is a house on it, built in 2006 and last sold in 2017. It is also going to auction for mortgage reasons. With so little inventory for me to look at I am really interested in seeing if this could work for me.

Here are some of my questions......I am hoping that someone can help me.

- The Sherriff's website lists both the plaintiff's attorney's name and phone number, as well as the mortgage company. Is it worth my while to call one or the other and ask if I could buy from them ahead of the sale? And if so does that mitigate risk at all? Or once it is listed with the Sherriff there is no stopping the auction?

- If I do decide to bid should I only plan on bidding the land value in case the home is extremely damaged?

- The auction is in a little over two weeks...is that enough time to get a title search?

- Are there realtor's or attorneys that I could hire to help protect me? If so how do I go about finding one?

- How do I get the Rule 3129.1 affidavit filed with the Prothonotary’s Office by the plaintiff?

As an FYI the terms are 20% immediately and the balance in 10 days. Tax and municipal liens are paid from the proceeds of the sale.

"Mold, roof, HVAC","We are under contract on a house. Before we made our offer, the listing agent claimed that the HVAC was fully inspected and in great condition and that the roof was brand new. We made our offer based on those assumptions and were accepted.

We just had our inspections completed and the HVAC is currently working but it is on its last legs and needs replacing.

The roof was just replaced, but was done very sloppily and now requires a lot of repairs, just one month after being replaced. You can easily see the issues with the roofing from the street- it looks really bad.

On top of this, the mold inspection came back with very high levels of 3 different types of mold- Aspergillus, cladosporium, myxomycetes, and unspecified spores. There is a strong smell in the house that we assumed was from owners smoking pot, but inspector said he believes they were growing pot inside as well.

Additionally, there are electrical issues- we have called an electrician to evaluate the electrical and will know more later this week.

We are currently getting quotes for new HVAC, roof repairs, and mold remediation, as well as a deep clean of the house and plan to ask for sellers credit for the work, but I’m at the point that I’m wondering if it’s even worth it.

FWIW, this home was NOT priced as a home that needed this much work. It was priced at full market value. My biggest concern is the mold as my son has very bad asthma.

Would love to hear your thoughts on how to proceed or any similar experiences you may have had.

Quit claim deed Help,"10 years ago my mom gifted the house she was currently living in to my brother and I in a legal document that was signed and processed with a date of 2015. I have the paper work for this transaction. The reason was that she was going through a divorce and she did not want her then husband to get any money from the house while going through their separation.

Fast forward 10 years and now my mom is in assisted living and my brother and I want to sell the house and split the money because my mom is close to qualifying for Medicaid and the money technically isn't in her name and so the money shouldn't legally go to her and she doesn't need the money because that's what Medicaid is for.

What I'm wondering is anyone's experience that is similar to mine with selling a house that they own only as a result of a quit claim deed. It should also be noted that there was some wordage in the document stating my mom maintain the right to live at the property until it was sold and so the house isn't sold and she's not going to be moving back there any time but just making sure before my brother and I think this money is going to us what should the realistic expectations be?

First-Time Homebuyer Dilemma: Help Me Pick the Perfect Realtor!,"I'm currently in the process of buying my first home here in Texas—exciting, but the wide range of options for choosing a realtor has me feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Some of my options include:

A friend who is a realtor, though I’m unsure of her expertise.
Realtors I’ve met in person at parties or events once or twice, who share my native language and cultural background (as I’m an immigrant in the US).
An agent recommended by my lender.
Agents suggested by friends who had great home-buying experiences, though I’m concerned that the type of properties I’m seeking may differ from what suited them. I explain my goal at the end.
A Redfin agent automatically assigned to my account.
Agents with active YouTube channels showcasing their expertise.

How do I find help apartment hunting?,"I’m moving across the country to SD, and this will be my first time looking for an apartment alone. I would like to find help looking for an apartment because I feel like I’ll have better luck finding a good place in my price range than I would on Zillow and other sites. I read real estate agents usually charge a month’s rent fee for help find a rental. I can’t afford that. But, I would rather pay a fee to have someone help me find an apartment that is a really good deal and better than I’d find alone or online. I was told in some cities there are apartment complexes/landlords that will pay real estate agents to help find tenants or they will cover first month rent to draw you into leasing. Any advice on where I could get help on finding a good apartment would be really appreciated.

Basement Crack Leaking,"My brother bought a house last year, and a few weeks ago water leaked into his basement after some heavy rain, through a crack that was supposed to have been fixed by the seller. After speaking with a real estate lawyer about the crack in the basement leaking, my brother said the lawyer doesn't think he has a case because on the Seller's Disclosure, the 'unknown' box is checked next to the 'Is the basement leaking water' question, followed by 'Crack repaired 2/24, no significant rains occurred since repair'.

Apparently, the guy who fixed it is just a handyman whose company only specializes in general home repairs, not specifically basement repairs. If the repair was not done correctly by a professional basement expert, why wouldn't the seller be held liable for the repair if the fix didn't work? It was not stated who did the repair in the seller's disclosure, so one would think it was repaired by a professional. What other recourse does my brother have? Different lawyer?",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jis594/basement_crack_leaking/

Walk Away from Condo in Bay Area,"We’re in escrow on a $389K condo with $732/month HOA. My wife and two boys love it, but I’m second-guessing the decision. I’m the sole income earner (wife just got into nursing school), and the numbers are making me nervous. For reference I make $110K gross or $9,167.00 gross and $7,304 NET monthly. Payments with HOA and insurance would be around $3,542.00.

We’d be putting 5% down on a conventional loan at 6.375%. Right now, we rent a 2 bed/2 bath for $1,800 on a busy street with MIL. She gets her own bathroom and room wife and boys share the bathroom. Schools are just okay, but our kids are still in preschool and TK.

Here’s what worries me: Over 5 years, I’d pay about $174K out-of-pocket (mortgage + HOA), but only gain about $99K in equity (appreciation + principal).Assuming 3.5% from comps in area and accounting for tax benefits. That’s a net loss of around $74K.

If we kept renting and saved the difference, we could have $120K saved for a better down payment in 5 years—plus my wife would be working by then.

Am I being too financially cautious here? Or is this a smart pause before a long-term commitment? Wife and MIL have some boundary issues and I want to move us out so she can feel more at ease. May help put me at ease when I get home seeing her more relaxed. It's not anything crazy just uncomfortable at times but still great most days I would say 80% days okay most months.

As context, this is my first property and I am also nervous of potential recession with everything that is going on in the news and rather not expose myself financially.",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jijetk/walk_away_from_condo_in_bay_area/
Is this normal home buying advice?,"I’m trying to figure out if my dad hates me, or is just bad at his job. My dad is a licensed contractor that used to be a builder but is now a realtor. Since I knew nothing about real estate and was moving near them, in 2018 my wife and i wanted to buy a home, made our goals really clear and he was ready to help. Since i knew nothing about real estate and wanted to learn his wisdom, i felt pretty excited.

He printed up a list of random houses to show my wife before I got there and it seems like he wanted to show her a bunch of shitty one’s first to let her see them. Not sure why because it didn’t match our goals and were all way under our budget. It went on like this when I got to town, and finally he showed us a halfway decent one so we were excited after seeing ones in unsafe areas that were dilapidated.

When there the former owner told my wife and I a bunch of lies about the property in front of my dad. We were stoked so we talked and made an offer. My dad corrected none of the lies for us.

He then said he would inspect the house for us. For the record I had no clue there were home inspectors or I would have paid for one. He crawled around and said it was good, zero issues except a few cracked tiles and the sunroom needed to be repaired.

Our offer was accepted. This was 2018 and he had convinced us to give a full price offer plus some to make sure we got it.

During final walkthrough I noticed the sunroom wasn’t repaired. They literally cut things up, hacked it and just screwed hardboard on the inside and outside. I was horrified and made. My dad said it was no big deal we could easily fix it. He didn’t tell us we could still back out. Turns out we could have and I would have had I known.

The owner also had all of his stuff still in the side of the house, which I wanted out. He said don’t worry about it it’ll be gone within the week:. Well two months later his crap was still there. He would show up and take a few things almost everyday while hanging with friends. He finally finished at about month 3 and left all the garbage, which required spending a lot to remove.

As it turns out, the house was a wreck.

The day we moved in it reeked like cat pee. The scented smells has gone out and the windows were closed and lo and behold it was bad. My dad said no worry he’ll get the floors cleaned, they’re special pet floors so it’ll be fine. The floors reeked like vinegar and still do 7 years later from the treatment.I had to pull out carpet of one room because it smelled so bad.

Our first water bill came in 3x higher than it should have. There was a massive leak and we had to remove all landscaping to get it. The pool when I hopped in the first time I crashed through it and had to be 10 grand to get it demolished. The sunroom repair wrecked the sunroom and the cement was a mess under the peeling lawn carpet so we pay to demo that. The vines fell off the walls d it turned out the house wasn’t even painted the same color behind it. Had to paint the house. Turns out none of the vents are connected to the roof, including showers, oven and stove. Turns out the hvac vents weren’t connected sometimes with 12 inch gaps. The roof has a piece of wood totally cracked in half and the plywood underlay even broken down I places. The electric panel is illegally wired up. Roof leak went through ceiling first rain and required fixing the leak and ceiling (not where he said there was an issue). The shower pan is crooked clearly and the list goes on and on and on.

When the appliances went out the first 3 months my grandpa who also does real estate said, just call home warranty. I said what’s a home warranty.

I found all of these things myself after things started breaking and I decided to go searching to see what was wrong.

When I asked him for help figuring out what to prioritize repairing so I can sell the house and get one that isn’t a house of cards, he did the fake “I feel so sick about it”. I said I don’t care to make him feel bad I just want advice but I couldn’t get him to give me any tips. He said he’d put me on the mls again. He did but never recommended any houses and when I told him I liked houses he’d ignore me.

I waited like that for a few years and now can’t afford anything out there and he tells me I won’t hardly make my money back on the house even though everything else has gone up 2-3X.

I’m feeling like he must hate me because he didn’t give me any good advice and seemed to want to just close a deal. Is this all normal real estate advice? I literally just wanted to learn from him but so far I’ve learned to trust no one, get a warranty, and get a home inspection from an inspector. I also know what to look for with a lot of things given the book of problems this house had and most of them now seem obvious that even if he wasn’t an inspector, he should have known.

Related to this, do any of you have any recommendations of programs I can learn from so if I can ever afford a house again I’ll be ready?",https://old.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jij2f9/is_this_normal_home_buying_advice/
